Sneakers shop application (Nike Shoes App) using Flutter + Animations

Descriptions
🤖👋 Hey there!

As part of my Flutter 100 days challenge, I developed an app for some practice. It was a great opportunity for me to explore animation techniques, which I used for the first time in this project. 🎬 While I was browsing through the Dribble website, I stumbled upon an interesting UI design that caught my attention. Although it was simple, I thought it had potential, so I decided to tweak and enhance it to my liking. 💡

Overall, I'm pretty excited about how this project turned out and I hope you will enjoy it too! ❤️
